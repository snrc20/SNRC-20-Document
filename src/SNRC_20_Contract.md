# SNRC-20 Contract

An `SNRC-20` contract refers to a contract that can issue `SNRC-20` operations. As is well known, since there are no EOA addresses in Starknet, accounts themselves are contracts, and you can consider SNRC-20 as an extension of abstract accounts. Anyone can deploy an independent `SNRC-20` contract, or integrate the interface defined below into a contract to become an `SNRC-20` compatible contract.
