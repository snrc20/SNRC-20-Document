# What is SNRC-20?

`SNRC-20` is an inscription standard based on Starknet, developed by developers from the Starknet community worldwide as a public good, capable of off-chain computation and verification.

`SNRC-20` not only includes standards for the inscription, but also provides integration interfaces for SNRC-20-compatible smart contracts and suggestions for implementing indexers. 

`SNRC-20` strives to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency in all processes.

This standard is inspired by the following projects/standards:
- [BRC-20](https://domo-2.gitbook.io/brc-20-experiment/)
- [Ethscriptions](https://docs.ethscriptions.com/overview/introducing-ethscriptions)
